# Iryna Rudzko

A teacher of English who is trying to become a frontend developer.

## About me
I am 23 and currently work for International House Minsk as a teacher of English. I have always been interested in languages but being on lockdown since March I suddenly realized it wasn't something I would like to spend my next years on. I realised I helped people make their dreams come true but I forgot about my own dreams which I used to have being a child.

I've worked as a corporate teacher in some IT-companies and have also been inspired by some of my good friends who are programmers. All of a sudden I started learning this programming thing from the mid summer and have still enjoyed doing this. I get excited before every task and ready to work really hard. 

I am a fast learner who is really interested in any kind of technologies and loves staying up-to-date. I am sure I could become a valuable asset to your team.
